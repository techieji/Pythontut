# Types: Part 1

Python is a simple language. It has many intuitive concepts and easy to understand ideals. Since there is no reason to waste time, let's jump right in with types. A type is exactly what a type means. If two things have different types, they are different things. A type is a very important thing in the field of programming language, but we won't mess around with all that. All we need to do is to know why it's important and how to take advantage of it. Let us start with a real world example. A bed is a piece of furniture. A bowl of pasta is some food. If we thought that the bowl of pasta was a bed, things would be very wrong. Similarly, if a computer thinks that a number is a piece of text, things could go very wrong. So let's see how to prevent that.

First, we should start the python interpreter. If you're on windows, open the executable which was installed when you executed the installer. It should be at the top of the list of apps, under 'newly installed'. If you're on Linux, type `python3` into the cmd-line. If these don't work, look elsewhere for how to run python and then come back here.

Well, now that we got python running, let's see what the interface is. You should see a a prompt like so:

```
[... A bunch of text saying stuff about Python ... ]
>>>
```

When you type something, it appears after the `>>>`. In order to evaluate a python statement, you should enter something after the prompt and then press enter. The result should be printed out. Now that we've got the UI down, let's move on to types.
